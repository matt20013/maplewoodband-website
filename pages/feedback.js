        “The mists of the hangover are just clearing (!) and we wanted to email and say thank you so so much for making it a brilliant evening! 

          We’ve had so many comments about how much people enjoyed the ceilidh and there were people on the dance floor we never expected to see up and joining in, so you did an absolutely brilliant job, thank you so much!”

          Steve and the Maplewood band were fabulous and did an amazing job of including the diverse group of dancers from young and old. I’m seriously considering the Poynton Ceilidhs now.”

          <p>“Wow, what a party!   Thank you so much for giving us a fantastic ceilidh which absolutely everyone enjoyed (as you could probably tell!).

          Chas as a fellow musician particularly relished the way you all just enjoyed playing together, whether for the reels etc or just as incidental music before anyone even arrived!  And your calling was exactly right, gentle but clear.

          I know it’s only just February but it has already been called the party of the year and that’s how it felt.  Thank you all for making it possible.”</p>
